# Azure API Management DevOps Example

This repository contains examples and tools to help you achieve API DevOps with Azure API Management.

## Background

Organizations today often have multiple deployment environments (e.g., development, QA, production) and use separate API Management (APIM) instances for each environment. In many cases, those environments are shared by a variety of API development teams each responsible for one more APIs. It becomes a challenge for organizations to automate deployment of APIs into a shared environment without interference between the teams and/or impact on API consumers.

In this repository, we propose an approach for the problem along with examples and tools to implement the solution.

## API DevOps with API Management

The proposed approach is shown in the below picture.

In this example, there are two deployment environments: _Development_ and _Production_, each environment has its own APIM instance. _API developers_ have access to the _Development_ instance and can use it for developing and testing their APIs. The _Production_ instance is managed by a designated team called the _API publishers_.

One of the key thing is to keep your APIM configurations in Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates under your SCM systems. In this example, we use GIT. There is a _Publisher repository_ that contains all the configurations of the _Production_ instance. _API developers_ can fork and clone the _Publisher repository_ and then start working on their own APIs in their own repository.

There are two types of ARM templates: the _Service template_ contains all the configurations related to APIM instances (e.g., SKU type, Custom URL) and shared resources across all APIs (e.g., Named Values). For each API, there is an _API Template_ that contains all the configurations related to the API and its sub-resources (e.g., API definition, policies).

One challenge for _API developers_ is to author the _API template_, which is an error-prone task. Therefore, we will build and open source an ARM template generator to help you generate _API templates_ based on Open API (aka., Swagger) files and policy files. With this tool, _API developers_ can continue focusing on the formats they are familiar with.

When _API developers_ finish develop and test an API, and have generated the _API template_ for it, they can submit a pull request to merge the changes back to the _Publisher repository_. _API publishers_ can validate the pull request to make sure the _Service template_ is not touched and all the changes in the _API template_ is compliant to the corporate standards. Most of the validations can be automated as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

Once the changes are merged successfully, then _API publishers_ can deploy them to the _Production_ instance either on schedule or on request.

With this approach, it is easy to migrate changes from one environment to another. Also, since different API development teams will be working on different sets of API templates and files, it also prevents them from colliding with each other.

We have provided an [example](Example.md) on how to use this approach and deploy using the Azure CLI.

We realize our customers bring a wide range of engineering cultures and existing automation solutions. The approach proposed here is not meant to be a one-size-fits-all solution. That's the reason we created this repository and open sourced everything, so that you can extend and custom the solution.
