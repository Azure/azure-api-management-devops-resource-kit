# Supported  2021-08-01
Below there is a table with all [operation-groups exposed by API Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/apimanagement/). Every operation group is marked as *supported* ✓, *not supported* ✗ or *skipped* **-**. Also, there is information in which first resource-kit version resource extraction was supported.

Some of operations could be skipped (not needed for extraction), because they are not providing any **resource-specific** information about the Azure APIM Instance.
